# Boilerplate for Jekyll Sites

## What is it?

This is my personal project-boilerplate.

I wouldn't recommend to use it as it is for your project. It's not documented.
It's just a collection of files, that i use in almost every Jekyll project.


## Includes

What is in it?
* Jekyll Core
* Emoticons (jemoji)
* ReadingTime for Articles
* Blog
* Google TagManager
* Footnotes
* NoIndex/Index for every page
* SkipToContent-Link for better a11y
* Columns with Flix-Grid
